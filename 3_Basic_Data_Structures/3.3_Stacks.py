# what distinguishes one linear structure from another is the
# way in which items are added and removed, in particular the location where these additions and removals occur.

# Stack (like a stack of pancakes) items are removed from the top and added from the top
#  Items stored at the base of the stack are there the longest. The most recently placed
# Item is moved first. LIFO last-in-first-out.  Newer items are at the top and older items
# are at the base. The order items are removed is exactly the reverse of the order that they were placed.
# Stacks can be used to reverse the order of items.  The order of insertion is reverse the order of removal

# ex: web browser back button, (as you navigate URL's get stored in a Stack)
